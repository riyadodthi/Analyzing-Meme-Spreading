# Analyzing-Meme-Spreading

This study investigates the role of eigenvector centrality versus betweenness centrality in modeling meme diffusion on social media networks. Simulations reveal that high eigenvector centrality nodes act as key "super-spreaders" of memes, initiating and influencing their propagation. The findings emphasize eigenvector centrality's significance in predicting and enhancing meme spread, with implications for marketing, advertising, and social media strategies.
